# DD2424

## Assignment 1
In this assignment you will train and test a one layer network with multi-ple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will train the network using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment you will train and test a two layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will train the network using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment you will train and test k-layer networks with multiple outputs to classify images (once again) from the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will upgrade your code from Assignment 2 in two significant ways. Firstly, generalizing your code so that you can train and test k-layer networks. Secondly, incorporating batch normalization into the k-layer network both for training and testing.

# Assignment 4
In this assignment you will train an RNN to synthesize English text character by character. You will train a vanilla RNN with outputs, as described in lecture 9, using the text from the book The Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling. The variation of SGD you will use for the optimization will be AdaGrad.
